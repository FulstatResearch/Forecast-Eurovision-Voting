# Forecast-Eurovision-Voting
Contestants will attempt to exploit these patterns in order to predict the voting for the 2010 Eurovision Song Contest. 

Before solve this problem, i will enumerate some forcast methods the following below:
+ Arithmetic Mean Method
+ Random Walk Method
+ Seasonal Random Walk Method
+ Random Walk with Drift Method
+ Forecasting Accuracy
+ Exponential Smoothing Methods
  + Simple Moving Average Method
  + Brown Simple Exponential Smoothing Method 
  + Holt Linear Trend Method
  + Exponential Trend Method
  + Gardner Additive Damped Trend Method
  + Taylor Multiplicative Damped Trend Method
  + Holt-Winters Additive Seasonality Method
  + Holt-Winters Multiplicative Seasonality Method
  + Methods Selection 
  + Methods Forecasting Accuracy
+ Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average Models
  + First Order Trend Stationary Time Series
  + ARIMA Model Specification
  + Random Walk with Drift ARIMA Model
  + Differentiated First Order ARIMA Model
  + Brown Simple Exponential Smoothing ARIMA Model
  + Holt Linear Trend ARIMA Model
  + Gardner Additive Damped Trend ARIMA Model
  + Seasonal Random Walk with Drift SARIMA Model
  + Seasonally Differentiated First Order SARIMA Model
  + Holt-Winters Additive Seasonality SARIMA Model
  + Models Selection
  + Models Forecasting Accuracy
  + Residuals White Noise

I will make clear & analytics methods above in forcasting model before solve this problem
